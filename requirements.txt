# In a requirements.txt file, the -e . entry is used to specify a local editable installation of a Python package. This is commonly known as an "editable" or "editable mode" installation.

# When you include -e . in your requirements.txt file, it tells pip to install the package from the current directory. This is useful during development when you're actively working on a package and want to install it in "editable" mode so that changes made to the code are immediately reflected without needing to reinstall the package.
